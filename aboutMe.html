        <h1 align="center"> About Me</h1>
        <p align="center"> 
          I've been interested in STEM for as long as I can remember, 
          and early in high school I was most interested in science; I led 
          the Science Olympiad club. In exchange for a space to run 
          experiments, I made a deal with the engineering teacher that I 
          would take the introductory engineering class. After that, I was 
          hooked on engineering in general and planned to study Chemical 
          Engineering. My freshman year of college, I realized that I enjoyed 
          programming much more through the introductory programming course
          and my experience on the VEX-U robotics team. I ended up majoring in 
          computer science instead!

          My internships have been crucial in narrowing down my 
          specific proffessional interest. My first internship at H-E-B's San Antonio
          Development Center made me particularly fascinated by full-stack software 
          engineering due to the vast amount of tools and skills utilized; I prefer 
          learning within a wide scope rather than becoming an expert in a narrow field. 
          Cybersecurity has appealed to me based on the classic image of defenders in 
          hoodies typing in dark rooms, and this fascination continued with my internship 
          the next year with their Application Security engineering team. This was a fun 
          combination of cybersecurity concepts and full-stack software engineering, and 
          what I'd like to continue doing professionally.

          In my personal life, I've become more interested in improving
          my physical and mental health. In pursuit of this, I've gone vegetarian and
          thoroughly enjoyed learning the new approach to cooking and trying new recipes, 
          some of which using herbs from my small garden (when they are still alive). 
          I've also realized that I enjoy exercising through yoga and interval training, 
          sometimes while listening to books and interesting podcasts. I'm hoping to
          continue improving my health in this way going forward, as well as getting a dog 
          and becoming more involved in a local shelter and/or garden.
