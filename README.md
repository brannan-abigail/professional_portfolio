# Portfolio
Initially created as a project for CSCE 315 and to be maintained and modified as a portfolio to showcase my projects and personality.

## Built With
HTML and CSS. I originally considered using React or Angular, but I realized that I didn't require anything so complex. My content is currently all static. 
In the future if I need something more complex, I will re-consider and modify it accordingly.
