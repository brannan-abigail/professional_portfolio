      <h1 align="center"> Work Experience </h1>
      <h3> Texas A&M's Fischer Engineering Design Center Technician (Prototyping Center) </h3>
        <p> Long before COVID hit, my freshman year, I sought a volunteer opportunity involved in Engineering, which led me to a part-time position as a 
          Engineering Innovation Center Student Technician, which later became the Fischer Engineering Design Center. There, I practiced working in a team 
          context, general customer service, teaching and consulting clients, a variety of prototyping techniques, and later leading the PCB Prototyping 
          technical team. I also increased administrative efficiency through the automation of approval criteria and relevant information transfers in the 
          Google application-based system. </p>
      <p> To supplement my coursework and obtain industry experience, I have sought and been fortunate enough to participate in Full-Stack 
        Engineering internships for the past three summers. By chance, these have occured in companies of increasing size, scope, and reach globally; from 
        a largely Texas-only Grocery store chain to a international credit card company, to a international bank and investment firm. The details of these
        experiences are below in chronological order. </p>
        <h3> H-E-B Software Engineering Intern (San Antonio Development Center) </h3>
          <p> Summer 2018, I assisted in planning a project digitizing H-E-B's Weekly Advertisement. I also created a small-scale web application to 
            interact with customer information, and email the results. This was accomplished using a mySQL database, the Spring framework, Angular, and 
            Bootstrap. </p>
        <h3> American Express Software Enigneering Intern (Application Security Engineering) </h3>
          <p> Last summer, Summer 2019, I collaborated in a scaled agile context to enhance a cloud-based internal application that statically-scans, reports 
            and recommends remediation(s) for vulnerabilities including published package vulnerabilities, secrets, and expired or duplicated certifications. 
            This was done through the coproduction and integration of a new feature to detect, store and display internally-produced dependencies utilizing 
            Node.js, React.js, GraphQL endpoints, Kubernetes and Docker, MongoDBâ€™s and RabbitMQ into the existing application. </p>
        <h3> JP. Morgan & Chase Software Engineering Program Intern (Corporate Investment Banking) </h3>
          <p> Summer 2020, I led a 7-intern team in improving the social media presence of the Community Learning Center through the creation and 
            presentation of a proof-of-concept Angular web app integrated with a Firebase database, gamefying the social media shares of the center's clients. 
            Additionally, I learned about various technological areas of the firm, particularly the solutions and processes related to Corporate Investment 
            Banking. </p>
        <h3> Future Ambitions </h3>
          <p> I am currently seeking a full-time Full-Stack Software Engineering position for after I graduate this May. My priority over the next 3-5 years 
            will be to further develop my technical skills in software engineering and cybersecurity to build a solid base so that in the future, if I want to 
            go into management, I will have a firm grasp of the context that my teams will be working with. To this end, I'm seeking a position that will 
            prioritize and support my growth.
          </p>
