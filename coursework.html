          <p> My academic journey has been rather winding, as it has taken me awhile to find my true passion and career ambitions. I began college studying Chemical 
            Engineering, during which I took Anthropology 201, Math 151 and 152, Psychology 107 and Physics 218. I did not enjoy my experiences in Chemistry 101, 111,
            102 and 112, but loved programming in Engineering 111 and 112. Because of this, and a determination to obtain an engineering degree, I applied to study 
            Computer Engineering at the end of my Freshman year. </p>
          <p> I was in the Computer Engineering program for two full academic years, in which I took Math 251, 308 and 311, Statistics 211, Physics 208, English 210, 
            Zumba, Yoga I,  and Political Science 206. My experiences in Computer Science and Engineering (CSCE) 121, 221, 222, 314 and 481, as well as in Electrical 
            Engineering 248, 214 and 314 made it clear that I loved software development and had no interest in the hardware elements. Thus, I switched my major to a 
            Bachelor of Science in Computer Science instead. </p>
          <p> Since then, I have taken Design Process 101, Strength Training, Yoga II, Political Science 207, Spanish 202 and Math 304. My major specific courses have 
            included CSCE 181, 312 and 315. In pursuit of my Cybersecurity minor following my interest in cybersecurity, I've also taken CSCE 402, Cybersecurity Law & 
            Policy, as well as CSCE 477, Cybersecurity Risk. </p>
          <p> This semester, I am taking Pilates, Philosophy 482 and CSCE 313. To learn how to be a more effective software engineer, I am also taking CSCE 436 and 
            431. CSCE 436 will to learn how to be a more effective full-stack software engineer through designing more effective and human-friendly interfaces, which 
            will enhance my technical expertise in front-end design and development. I am currently less familiar with this aspect fo full-stack engineering, and the 
            improvement will make me a better full-stack engineer by making my frontends as good as my backends, thereby making me a more well-rounded and valuable 
            candidate. CSCE 431 will make me more effective through teaching me the theory of the software engineering, practice in an actual project with a team, and
            exposure to new relevant technologies and methods. </p>
          <p> Next summer, I will be taking Barre, as well as rounding out my core CSCE and Cybersecurity knowledge with CSCE 410, 411, 465, 482 and possibly Math 470 
            if I feel that I have the bandwidth. I believe these courses will give me a solid foundation of knowledge regarding Operating Systems, Networks and securing
            them, as well as fulfill my general CSCE requirements. I'm excited for what's ahead! </p>
