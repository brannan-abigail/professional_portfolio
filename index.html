        Howdy! I'm Abby (or Abigail) Brannan, a 5th year senior Full-Stack Software Engineer studying Computer Science with a Cybersecurity Minor at Texas 
        A&M. More information about my coursework is available in the Coursework tab. I am interested in Software Engineering in general because I enjoy 
        solving problems, which feels like solving a puzzle, while getting to continuously learn new languages, philosophies and techniques, and making life 
        easier for people. Technology is a powerful tool for making positive change, and it's exciting to be a part of it!
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        The kind of positive change through technology that excite me the most revolve around developing software tools for cybersecurity and information 
        security professionals to better defend the integrity and security of their respective digital assets. In pursuit of this, I have interned as a 
        Full-Stack Engineer in a variety of areas with H-E-B, American Express and JP. Morgan & Chase to learn how to build software tools. More information 
        about each of these is available in the Work Experience tab.
